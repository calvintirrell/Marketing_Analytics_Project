Data context: 8 different countries (Australia, USA, Mexico, Spain, India, Germany, Canada and South Africa) represented by 2,240 people.

- Marketing campaign “Response” was overall the most successful with a 14% response rate.
- All other marketing campaigns had overall less than 8% response rates.

- Mexico had the highest reaction to the “Response” marketing ad campaign with a response rate at over 66%.
- The only other campaign with success in Mexico was Campaign 3 and that had a 33% response rate.

- This might seem impressive given that Mexico had the smallest population represented among the 8 countries.
- However, it's possible that due to the smaller population representing Mexico, is why the response rate was so high.

- All the other ad campaigns had a maximum of 16% response rate when seperated by distinct countries and marketing campaigns.
